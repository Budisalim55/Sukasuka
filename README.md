# Big

Big is a next generation application zero-framework which solves the domain problem of building web applications. 

## Big itself is zero lines long. 

Big applications are defined by a collection of composable [resources](http://github.com/bigcompany/resource) which can then be reflected across a variety of [well defined interfaces](http://github.com/bigcompany/resources).

#### Resources allow modules to compose

This repository contains [examples](https://github.com/bigcompany/big/tree/master/examples) and a [command-line tool](https://github.com/bigcompany/big/blob/master/bin/big) which uses a [cli](https://github.com/bigcompany/resources/tree/master/cli) resource to reflect [all resources](http://github.com/bigcompany/resources) and resource methods to the command line.

In a terminal, run:

```bash
npm install big -g
```

After `big` is installed run:

```bash
big
```

*On some systems you may have to `npm` with `sudo`*
